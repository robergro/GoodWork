Introduction
------------

This is a library package that includes the PHP Markdown parser and its 
sibling PHP Markdown Extra which additional features.

Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown
allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text
format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

"Markdown" is two things: a plain text markup syntax, and a software 
tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text markup to HTML. 
PHP Markdown is a port to PHP of the original Markdown program by 
John Gruber.

PHP Markdown can work as a plug-in for WordPress, as a modifier for
the Smarty templating engine, or as a replacement for Textile
formatting in any software that supports Textile.

Full documentation of Markdown's syntax is available on John's 
Markdown page: <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>
